6. I made some recommendations
- *Some recommendations to help unicorn companies in creating good business models and making decisions that will focus on companies with high growth potential, diversify an investment portfolio, and prioritize companies with experienced leadership teams include*;

1. Focus on countries with high average funding and a large number of unicorns, such as the United States and China. This will increase the chances of investing in startups with high growth potential and experienced leadership teams.
2. Consider investing in startups with a positive relationship between funding and valuation, as this indicates that the startup has a strong business model and is likely to have high growth potential.
3. Diversify the investment portfolio by investing in startups from different countries, industries, and stages of development. This will help spread risk and increase the chances of finding successful startups.
4. Prioritize startups with experienced leadership teams, as this is a key factor in the success of a startup. Look for founders and executives with a proven track record of success in their industry.
5. Use data analytics to identify trends and patterns in the startup ecosystem, such as emerging industries or technologies. This can help identify startups with high growth potential before they become widely known.
6. Build relationships with other investors and industry experts to share knowledge and insights about the startup ecosystem. This can help identify promising startups and provide valuable feedback to portfolio companies.

7. Formalities needed for this project
- How to connect to raw data/flat file
- Data cleaning
- Data Processing
- Data Modelling(Relationship between multiple tables)
- KPI and Advance KPI generations
- creating measures in the report
- creating different charts and generalizing insights
- Export the charts to PowerPoint for presentation.
  
8. Challenges faced
- I made extensive cleaning of my data, I had to check my columns, know them, check the types, check for missing values, visualize it, then I had to do insights based on what I cleaned for use.
- I had to make further research on the unicorn companies to know my dataset more
- I had issues with replacing missing values but was able to do it.

I'm grateful to Quantum analysis ng, the tutor, and Mr. Jonathan for making this project a possibility I learned a lot. Thanks
